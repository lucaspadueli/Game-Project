The Jumping-Faces Game
The Jumping-Faces Game is a web-based game that challenges players to collect yellow faces for points while avoiding gray faces that cause game over. The game was built using Canvas and JavaScript and can be played on any modern web browser.

Gameplay
In The Jumping-Faces Game, you play as a character who can move left and right using the arrow keys and jump using the up arrow key. The goal of the game is to collect as many yellow faces as possible for points, while avoiding gray faces that end the game. There is also a yellow element that goes up, which if reached, will deduct 5 points. The game ends after 1 minute of playtime.

The yellow faces are worth 5 points each, while the gray faces will result in an instant game over. If the player reaches the end of the game with 100 or more points, they win. If the player reaches the end of the game with less than 100 points, they lose. If the player hits a gray face before the end of the 1 minute game time, they also lose.

After 20 seconds, the speed of the faces will increase every 10 seconds. After 30 seconds, there will be one more face of each color.

How to Play
